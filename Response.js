          '<p>Bitcoin is the first digital currency that allows users to send and receive money, without the interference of a central bank or government. Instead, a network of thousands of peers is controlling the transactions; a decentralized system.</p>\n\n<h3>Why does bitcoin have value?</h3>\n\n<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s useful qualities (decentralized, borderless, secure) aren&rsquo;t the only reason the coin is worth so much. Due to its scarcity (and it&rsquo;s hard to produce), Bitcoin is often nicknamed &lsquo;Digital Gold&rsquo;, in reference to &lsquo;classic&rsquo; physical gold. Like gold, Bitcoin also has a finite supply of coins available; there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. And now you know why the creation of new bitcoins is also called mining.</p>\n\n<h3>No inflation in bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p>Bitcoin was invented in response to a few concerns the inventor(s) had, such as inflation. Its supply is limited, so one cannot just devalue the currency by printing more, as governments often do with fiat currencies (USD, EUR, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>As people look for alternative places to keep their money rather than losing value in a negative interest rate account, Bitcoin becomes more appealing. Big global companies, such as Tesla and MicroStrategy already purchased serious amounts of Bitcoin. And it&#39;s only a matter of time that other companies will follow. This also ensures that the value remains or continues to increase.</p>\n\n<h3>Who built Bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p>In 2008, Bitcoin was invented by an anonymous person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2009, Bitcoin was released as open-source software. Nakamoto&rsquo;s real identity is still unknown, although there are many theories about who it might be. Decentralization is one of Bitcoin&rsquo;s most important principles, and that&rsquo;s why this anonymity is perfectly in line.</p>\n\n<h3>The technology of Bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p>The Bitcoin blockchain is a database, the so-called &lsquo;ledger&rsquo;, that consists of bitcoin transaction records. For new transactions to be added to the ledger, the nodes must agree that the transaction is real and valid. The blockchain is public and contains records of all the transactions taking place.</p>\n\n<h3>How to buy bitcoin?</h3>\n\n<p>Continue reading <a href="https://coinranking.com/blog/how-to-buy-your-first-bitcoin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this blog article</a> on how to buy your first bitcoin.</p>\n',

It allows developers to deploy all sorts of decentralized applications (Dapps), without the interference of third parties. Ethereum is also used for its own cryptocurrency ether. Ethereum is now the world’s second-most valued cryptocurrency platform.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Ethereum</h3>\n<p>Ethereum is created as a blockchain platform on which other applications could be built on top of. Most of the online services, businesses and enterprises are built on a centralized system of governance. Ethereum aims to decentralize the existing client-server model; servers and clouds are replaced by so-called nodes, run by volunteers from all over the world. Ethereum’s vision is that it would enable this same functionality to people anywhere around the world, enabling them to compete to offer services on top of this infrastructure.</p>\n<h3>Who built Ethereum</h3>\n<p>Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin. In 2014, Buterin and the other co-founders launched a campaign where they sold ether (Ethereum tokens) to raise money to build their vision. Since the launch of the white paper in 2015, the platform has grown fast, and these days there are hundreds of developers involved.</p>",

Tether belongs to the category cryptocurrencies called stablecoins that aims to keep cryptocurrency valuations stable, in opposition to other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>\n\n<h3>The goal of Tether</h3>\n\n<p>Tether was designed to build a bridge between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, with the benefits of cross-border payments facilitated by blockchain technology. Its purpose is to provide a token that represents a fiat currency at a 1:1 ratio, with in this case US dollar.</p>\n\n<h3>Who started Tether</h3>\n\n<p>In July 2014, Tether was first launched as RealCoin. Later it was rebranded as Tether in November 2014 by Tether Ltd., the company that is responsible for maintaining the reserve amounts of fiat currency. It started trading in February 2015. The project was initially founded by Bitcoin Foundation director Brock Pierce, software engineer Craig Sellars, and entrepreneur Reeve Collins.</p>\n",

          "<p>Solana&nbsp;is a high-performance cryptocurrency blockchain which supports smart contracts and decentralized applications. It uses a proof of stake consensus mechanism with a low barrier to entry along with timestamped transactions to maximize efficiency.This allows Solana to process 50-65 000 transactions per second with a theoretical limit of over 700 00 transactions per second (compared to Bitcoin&rsquo;s 7 TPS and Ethereum&rsquo;s 15 TPS). In contrast to other similar projects such as&nbsp;Polkadot.<br />\nThe team at Solana has designed their blockchain with a long-term vision in mind. This comes from founder Anatoly Yakovenko&rsquo;s own experience watching telecommunications technologies almost double in capability every year during his time at Qualcomm.<br />\nSolana is developed by a company of the same name which is based in San Diego, California. The Solana team consists of former Qualcomm, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Dropbox employees. In addition to being based on similar database technologies used by Google and Microsoft, Solana&rsquo;s architecture is also inspired by&nbsp;Filecoin, a decentralized data storage cryptocurrency project.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How does Solana Work?</strong><br />\n<br />\nDisclaimer: Solana is incredibly complex. Start with a term you may have heard if you have looked at the project before:&nbsp;Proof of History&nbsp;(PoH). PoH is not a consensus mechanism. Rather, it is a component in Solana&rsquo;s Proof of Stake consensus. PoH involves timestamping transactions when they are added to a Solana block. A new block on Solana is generated every 400ms (compared to Ethereum&rsquo;s roughly 15 seconds and Bitcoin&rsquo;s 10 minutes).Without getting into too much detail, the&nbsp;decentralized clock&nbsp;which is used as reference for the timestamps is the SHA256 hash function. SHA256 may sound familiar because it is used in Bitcoin&rsquo;s Proof of Work consensus mechanism. However, instead of working to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; the hash functions to produce a new block, Solana instead uses SHA256&rsquo;s repetitive outputs as reference &ndash; timestamps. This produces a sort of &ldquo;clock tick&rdquo; where each clock tick is 400ms (instead of one second like a regular clock).<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

The overall focus beyond a particular set of innovations is to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem that better accounts for the needs of its users as well as other systems seeking integration. Cardano did not begin with a comprehensive roadmap or even an authoritative white paper. It started with a collection of design principles, engineering best practices and avenues for exploration. The Cardano platform now features decentralized applications and contracts that operate at low cost in a secure and scalable way.</p>\n<h3>Who started Cardano</h3>\n<p>Cardano was launched in 2017, and founded by Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum. Charles said he wanted to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem for cryptocurrencies. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.</p>",

          "<p>HEX (HEX) is designed as a store of value for a Certificate of Deposit on the blockchain as used in traditional financial markets. HEX is also designed to leverage off the emerging DeFi. HEX is designed and launched by Richard Heart on 2 December 2019.</p>\n<h3>The goal of HEX</h3>\n<p>HEX is an ERC20 token launched on the Ethereum network. HEX is designed to be a store of value to replace the Certificate of Deposit as the blockchain counterpart of that financial product used in traditional financial markets. HEX is also designed to leverage off the emerging DeFi (Decentralised Finance) ecosystem in cryptocurrencies within the Ethereum network.</p>\n<h3>The technology of HEX</h3>\n<p>HEX uses the Ethereum network for the transaction layer (sending and receiving HEX tokens, as well as interacting with the HEX smart contract), whilst the consensus code and staking mechanism is contained in the HEX smart contract.</p>\n<h3>Staking HEX</h3>\n<p>HEX allows a user to stake his or her HEX coins for a share of the new HEX coin issuance, or inflation and contains features designed to incentivize behaviors that encourage price appreciation and disincentivize behaviors that encourage harm to the price. The HEX smart contract penalizes stakers for ending their stake early and rewards them for staking larger amounts of HEX for longer periods. HEX is distributed to Bitcoin holders by way of a snapshot of the Bitcoin UTXO set that occurred on 2 December 2019 at block height 606227. The distribution of HEX to Bitcoin holders is 10,000 HEX per 1 BTC. Bitcoin holders are able to claim HEX only during the first year of launch. During this period, HEX is also obtained in exchange for ETH through interacting with the HEX smart contract. At the end of the first year of launch, all HEX coins that were not claimed by Bitcoin holders are distributed to the rest of the HEX users who have stakes that are active. The maximum possible annual inflation of HEX is designed to be 3.69% after the first year of launch.</p>",

Polkadot aims to provide an internet where independent blockchains can swap information and transactions in a reliable way via the Polkadot relay chain.</p>\n\n<h3>The goal of Polkadot</h3>\n\n<p>Polkadot is created to enable a completely decentralized web where users are in control. Polkadot has to make it easier to create and connect decentralized applications, services, and institutions. By empowering innovators to build better solutions, the creators seek to free society from its reliance on a broken web where its large institutions can&rsquo;t violate its users&#39; trust.</p>\n\n<h3>Who built Polkadot</h3>\n\n<p>Polkadot is a project by Web3 Foundation, a Swiss Foundation founded to facilitate a fully functional and user-friendly decentralized web. The Web3 Foundation is partnering with entities to build Polkadot and support development.</p>\n\n<h3>The technology of Polkadot</h3>\n\n<p>Polkadot allows arbitrary data to be transferred across blockchains; Polkadot can transfer this data across public, open, permissionless blockchains as well as private, permissioned blockchains.This enables developers to build applications that get authorized data from a private blockchain and use it on a public blockchain.</p>\n",

Through a WBTC partner, 1 Bitcoin can be exchanged for 1 Wrapped Bitcoin, and vice-versa. The BTC that backs WBTC is verifiable through a &ldquo;proof of reserve&rdquo; system that verifies the 1:1 backing between minted WBTC tokens and Bitcoin stored by custodians. WBTC is maintained by a group called the WBTC DAO that consists of over 30 members. It was originally started by BitGo, Ren, and Kyber.</p>\n",

          "<p>Litecoin is a peer-to-peer decentralized digital currency with an instant, near zero-cost payment service to peers across the world. It features a faster transaction confirmation status, along with a refined storage competency. The average block mining speed in Litecoin is 2.5 minutes, compared to bitcoin’s 10 minutes.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Litecoin</h3>\n<p>Litecoin wants to provide a more decentralized mining network, faster transaction processing times, lower transaction fees and less scarcity. The price of each litecoin is cheaper than bitcoin, and transactions are easier, because there are more Litecoins that can be created by mining. Litecoin is often referred to ‘silver’, whilst Bitcoin is compared with ‘gold.’</p>\n<h3>Who started Litecoin</h3>\n<p>In October 2011, litecoin was released via an open-source client on GitHub. (A client is a piece of software that accesses a service made available by a server.) It is basically a fork of the Bitcoin Core client. Charlie Lee is the managing director of the Litecoin Foundation. He’s an ex-Google employee who had the vision to create a lighter version of Bitcoin.</p>",

          "<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a hard fork of bitcoin. It’s an electronic cash platform that allows peer-to-peer online cash payments to be made without the clearance of a clearinghouse. One of the most pressing issues for bitcoin has always been its scalability; the size of a block of transactions was limited to one MB. Bitcoin Cash was initiated to increase this block size.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Bitcoin Cash</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin cash is very similar to bitcoin and also used as a payment system. Bitcoin Cash allows faster transaction times and lower transaction fees; it enabled the increase of the block size from one MB to eight MB. Its overall goal is to increase the number of transactions that can be processed by the network.</p>\n<h3>Who started Bitcoin Cash</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin Cash was officially released in August 2017, as a result of a discussion about the scalability of Bitcoin; the community had some concerns about Bitcoin’s ability to process the large number of transactions on the Bitcoin network. Looking for a solution, the community was divided into two groups. Unable to find a compromise, a hard fork was implemented, and Bitcoin Cash was created.</p>",

The network is made of many independent blockchains that utilize Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanisms, including Tendermint BFT. (BFT is the feature of a distributed network to reach consensus even when some of the nodes in the network fail to respond or respond with incorrect information.) Each individual blockchain maintains control of its own governance but is interoperable with other blockchains in the network. Blockchains not using BFT algorithms can be connected to the Cosmos network via &ldquo;adaptor&rdquo; blockchains.</p>\n\n<h3>The goal of Cosmos</h3>\n\n<p>Cosmos was not designed for one particular use case, but to be adaptable to suit many different use cases. The project tries to solve several blockchain problems, focussing on scalability, usability and interoperability. Cosmos aims to create what they describe as the &ldquo;&lsquo;Internet of Blockchains&rdquo;, a network of blockchains able to communicate with each other in a decentralized way. ATOm is the native staking token of the Cosmos Hub, however, it&rsquo;s not the sole asset of the Hub or the entire network. The Cosmos Hub is a &ldquo;multi-asset&rdquo; blockchain and other blockchains in the network can have their own native assets.</p>\n",

Its native asset, originally known as Stellar, was later called Lumens (XLM). XLM powers the Stellar network and all of its operations.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Stellar</h3>\n<p>Stellar makes it possible to create, send, and trade digital representations of all forms of money: dollars, pesos, bitcoin, pretty much anything. It’s designed so all the world’s financial systems can work together on a single network. With this financial system they fight poverty and help develop individual potential. Stellar is useful and valuable because it is capable of hosting thousands of exchanges between currencies and tokens per second.</p>\n<h3>Who started Stellar</h3>\n<p>In 2014, Jed McCaleb, founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. The nonprofit Stellar Development Foundation was created in collaboration with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, later in 2014. This foundation employs technologists, scientists, designers, and businesspeople, all dedicated to building a more inclusive global marketplace. Their goal is to unlock the world’s economic potential by making money more fluid and people more empowered.</p>",

          "<p>Ethereum Classic (ETC)  is a decentralized smart contracts platform which is a continuation of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum Classic preserves original history, excluding external interference and altered transactions. Applications are run exactly as programmed without the possibility of censorship, downtime, or third-party interference. The distributed network consists of a blockchain ledger, native cryptocurrency, and robust ecosystem of on-chain applications and services.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Ethereum Classic</h3>\n<p>The goal of the original project Ethereum was to expand the use cases for cryptocurrencies to applications beyond money. Ethereum enables developers to create new cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications running on top of its blockchain. Ethereum Classic aims to continue this vision. It differs from Ethereum in its technical decisions, made by the developers.</p>\n<h3>Who started Ethereum Classic</h3>\n<p>It’s difficult to say who created Ethereum Classic. The developer most associated with the decision to continue maintaining the original Ethereum is the anonymous Arvicco. Some say, because much of this code is from the original Ethereum developers, that Ethereum’s founder Vitalik Buterin, and his team can be seen as the ones responsible for most of Ethereum Classic’s technical innovations.</p>",

Also, the platform aims to boost the security of smart contracts through formal verification of code. The creators of Tezos believe that a decentralized system must be decentralized at all levels; all the decisions must be taken decentralized, especially the proposals to improve or change the project.</p>\n\n<h3>The goal of Tezos</h3>\n\n<p>Tezos focusses on three main issues; smart contract safety, long-term upgradability, and open participation. Tezos is designed to provide the code correctness and safety that is necessary for assets and other important use cases. Tezos has a so-called modular architecture, which refers to the design of a system composed of separate components that can be connected together. Together with its formal upgrade mechanism, Tezos&rsquo; allows the network to adopt and propose innovations very smoothly. All stakeholders may participate in network upgrades by evaluating, proposing, or approving changes.</p>\n\n<h3>Who started Tezos</h3>\n\n<p>Since 2014, co-founders (while being a couple) Arthur Breitman and Kathleen Breitman, have been developing Tezos with a core group of developers. In 2017, the Tezos Foundation headquartered in Switzerland raised $232 million in just two weeks in a fundraiser. It became one of the biggest ICOs.</p>\n",

As first, the LEO token will support the reduction of taker and lending fees for the use of trading platforms, products and services offered by the iFinex. Second, as LEO is the utility token found at the heart of the Bitfinex ecosystem, it is supposed to optimize the trading processes taking place in it. And proceeds from the LEO token initial exchange offering should help the organizers improve their business prospects.</p>\n\n<p>In 2012, <a href="https://bitfinex.com/?refcode=UbLuXyT0K" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bitfinex</a> was founded as a peer-to-peer Bitcoin-focused exchange, making it one of the older exchange players in the blockchain industry. In May 2019, its core team, which also managed the LEO token project, numbered more than 100 professionals. In line with the company&rsquo;s stated philosophy of favoring quality over quantity, the headcount of those strictly working on the development does not go above 25.</p>\n',

          "<p>Monero (XMR) is a cryptocurrency which focuses on being untraceable and private. It differs from Bitcoin&#39;s in a few key ways, but is very similar to Bitcoin: it&rsquo;s an anonymous version of Bitcoin. It can be used to buy and sell things, and be exchanged for other coins or tokens.</p>\n\n<h3>The goal of Monero</h3>\n\n<p>The privacy features of Monero gives it its most value. No one can link Monero cryptocurrency transactions to a person. Monero is also created for its fungibility, all Monero coins are identical and mutually interchangeable. Monero has dynamic scalability, which means it has no &ldquo;pre-set&rdquo; block size limit. Monero has ASIC resistance and multiple keys.</p>\n\n<h3>Who started Monero</h3>\n\n<p>Bytecoin, launched in 2012, was the precursor of Monero. It was the first digital currency that was written using a technology called CryptoNote. CryptoNote is the spine of most of the privacy-based cryptocurrencies that exist, including Monero. However, there were a few issues with Bytecoin, which lead to a group of seven developers to fork the Bytecoin blockchain. The new currency would be known as Bitmonero, later named Monero. Five of the seven developers decided to stay anonymous. Only two of these Monero developers are known: Riccardo Spagni and David Latapie.</p>\n",
